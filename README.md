# Website code example

 - Sass is compiled by my other project https://github.com/InstallationWizzard/Multiproject-Gulp (It is external, on itself working script so you have to configure it. To save you time I included public folder as well (someone pushes it someone does not.))
 - It is optimized ONLY for 1920x1080 Chrome
 - It is supposed to illustrate my average HTML and CSS structuring. If you are also interested into Javascript code I got large amount of private node project I could show on interest.
